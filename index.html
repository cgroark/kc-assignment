			<h5>Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys</h5>
				<p>Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys are primarily hired through our law school summer Rule 9 program.  Due to budget cuts over the past few years, the PAO does very little lateral hiring of bar certified attorneys.  Nonetheless, candidates are welcome to forward their materials to Heidi Parkington for consideration if openings do occur.</p>

			<h5>Deputy Assistant Attorneys</h5>
				<p>The King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office has regular need to hire term-limited deputy assistants (contract lawyers). Contracts are initially for six months and are often extended for up to one year. Potential work assignments include handling gross misdemeanor cases in the District Court Unit, handling gross misdemeanor and felony cases in the Juvenile Unit, assisting with drug and mainstream felony filings, and covering felony calendars. These positions provide excellent courtroom experience, especially for new or inexperienced lawyers. Deputy Assistants are interviewed throughout the year and considered for regular openings when they become available. Over the past few years, the PAO has hired many of our contract lawyers into regular positions as openings become available.</p>

				<p>Interested applicants may send a resume and cover letter to be kept on file for consideration in the event that we have a need to hire a deputy assistant attorney. Candidates must be bar qualified in the State of Washington. Application materials should be sent via e-mail to Heidi Parkington, Human Resources Director.</p>

			<h5>Administrative Staff</h5>
				<p>It is the policy of this office to promote from within our office as much as possible.  For that reason, most openings that are available to the general public are entry-level positions.  Entry-level job functions vary depending on the position assigned. Responsibilities include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Answering telephones, screening calls and responding to inquiries</li>

					<li>Opening, sorting and distributing incoming mail and processing outgoing mail</li>

					<li>Ordering and distributing supplies</li>

					<li>Photocopying various legal documents and ensuring proper distribution of documents</li>

					<li>Establishing and maintaining files, records and other informational sources on a daily basis</li>
				</ul>

			<p>Promotional opportunities come up regularly for staff and we have a career progression ladder within our office.</p>

			<p>Occasionally, we open higher level positions to the outside public. These are usually legal secretary and victim advocate vacancies.</p>

			<p>All recruiting announcements will be posted on the King County jobs page.</p>

			<p>Administrative staff members are represented by Teamsters Local 117 (external link).</p>

			<p>Applicants who are interested in being considered for any of these positions may send a resume and cover letter to be kept on file for consideration in the event that we have a need to hire an entry-level candidate.  Application materials should be sent via e-mail to Heidi Parkington, Human Resources Director</p>

			<h5>Reasonable Accommodation</h5>
				<p>Persons with disabilities may request special accommodations from the King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office in order to participate in a selection process or to perform work once hired. Requests for accommodations should be made as soon as possible. This may be done by a written letter or an appropriate alternative format to our offices, or phone 206-477-1205.</p>
