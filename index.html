			<h5 class='accord-header'>Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys</h5>
				<p>Deputy Prosecuting Attorneys are primarily hired through our law school summer Rule 9 program.  Due to budget cuts over the past few years, the PAO does very little lateral hiring of bar certified attorneys.  Nonetheless, candidates are welcome to forward their materials to Heidi Parkington for consideration if openings do occur.</p>

			<h5 class='accord-header'>Deputy Assistant Attorneys</h5>
				<p>The King County Prosecuting Attorney's Office has regular need to hire term-limited deputy assistants (contract lawyers). Contracts are initially for six months and are often extended for up to one year. Potential work assignments include handling gross misdemeanor cases in the District Court Unit, handling gross misdemeanor and felony cases in the Juvenile Unit, assisting with drug and mainstream felony filings, and covering felony calendars. These positions provide excellent courtroom experience, especially for new or inexperienced lawyers. Deputy Assistants are interviewed throughout the year and considered for regular openings when they become available. Over the past few years, the PAO has hired many of our contract lawyers into regular positions as openings become available.</p>

				<p>Interested applicants may send a resume and cover letter to be kept on file for consideration in the event that we have a need to hire a deputy assistant attorney. Candidates must be bar qualified in the State of Washington. Application materials should be sent via e-mail to Heidi Parkington, Human Resources Director.</p>

			<h5 class='accord-header'>Administrative Staff</h5>
				<p>It is the policy of this office to promote from within our office as much as possible.  For that reason, most openings that are available to the general public are entry-level positions.  Entry-level job functions vary depending on the position assigned. Responsibilities include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Answering telephones, screening calls and responding to inquiries</li>

					<li>Opening, sorting and distributing incoming mail and processing outgoing mail</li>

					<li>Ordering and distributing supplies</li>

					<li>Photocopying various legal documents and ensuring proper distribution of documents</li>

					<li>Establishing and maintaining files, records and other informational sources on a daily basis</li>
				</ul>

			<p>Promotional opportunities come up regularly for staff and we have a career progression ladder within our office.</p>

			<p>Occasionally, we open higher level positions to the outside public. These are usually legal secretary and victim advocate vacancies.</p>

			<p>All recruiting announcements will be posted on the King County jobs page.</p>

			<p>Administrative staff members are represented by Teamsters Local 117 (external link).</p>

			<p>Applicants who are interested in being considered for any of these positions may send a resume and cover letter to be kept on file for consideration in the event that we have a need to hire an entry-level candidate.  Application materials should be sent via e-mail to Heidi Parkington, Human Resources Director</p>

							<p>The Youth 180 Workshop is a true partnership between the King County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office (PAO) and the community it serves. This workshop offering provided by the nonprofit <a href='http://choose180.org/'>Choose 180</a> is a pre-filing juvenile diversion program designed to keep youth out of the criminal justice system.</p>
							<p>The PAO first partnered to launch the Youth 180 Workshop in 2011 as a pilot project after King County Prosecuting Attorney Dan Satterberg asked community leaders for help to reach youth in a new way.</p>
							<p>In July of 2011, the PAO, in partnership with the nonprofit organization <a href='http://choose180.org/'>Choose 180</a>, launched its first half-day workshop, where youth were invited to participate and hear from volunteer speakers who had dealt with some of the same issues and struggles the youth were dealing with and who made their own commitment to <a href='http://choose180.org/'>Choose 180</a> and change the direction of their life.</p>
							<p>Today, the 180 Program diverts approximately 400 youth each year from the criminal justice system. Saturday half-day workshops are held each month at Seattle University's School of Law. The university loans the space to <a href='http://choose180.org/'>Choose 180</a> and hosts the Youth 180 Workshops free of charge. Each of these 400 youth represents a host of costs that are avoided. For example, when 400 youth cannot be located or fail to respond to the diversion letter, each is arrested, charged with a crime, booked into the Youth Service Center, and assigned a public defender to represent them in juvenile court.</p>

The afternoon session focuses on enhancing self-confidence and introduces stress reduction techniques.</p>
							<p class='hiring-subheader'>Kids’ Court is designed for children ages 4-12. As the day progresses children in the group learn:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Why a witness is important and how to be confident in that role</li>
								<li>How kids can participate successfully in a the legal system through enhancing knowledge of courtroom procedures</li>
								<li>How to reduce feelings of fear and anxiety though relaxation techniques that are fun, easy and helpful</li>
								<li>Practical methods to manage courtroom worries such as, “What if I start to cry?” or “What if I don’t understand a question?”</li>
